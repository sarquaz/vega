## Vega

What if there was a technology so simple that small children with no prior computing experience could easily pick it up, using a programming language with a syntax described fully by a single page? What if it was so fast and energy efficient that it could run on most budget hardware, including robots that kids play with? What if kids were enjoying using it so much they were programing everything with it?

Initially lua became my top choice for embedding for following reasons:

- [lightweight](https://www.lua.org/about.html) implementation   

- [simple](http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/) syntax 
 



In the attempt to bring that vision to reality I have gone though several rewrites of the codebase  and have produced [tau](https://github.com/sarquaz/tau), a system library in C++ that Vega uses on the lower level.  Vega is designed to be very efficient, to allow for beautiful code, and to be the basis for feature rich applications. It is not finished, contributions are welcome.
